# Login Form

This project contains a simple and stylish login form that includes both HTML and CSS, as well as functionality for handling user login. The form allows users to enter their credentials (email and password), and includes a "remember me" checkbox and a "forgot password?" link.

## üìã Features

- **Email and Password Fields**: Users can input their email and password to log in.
- **Icon Support**: Icons are used for visual enhancement with the help of Boxicons.
- **"Remember Me" Option**: Allows users to stay logged in (checkbox).
- **Forgot Password Link**: Provides users with an option to reset their password.
- **Responsive Layout**: The form is designed to be mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes.
  
## üìÅ Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the login form structure and JavaScript for validation.
- **style.css**: External CSS file used for styling the form.
- **boxicons.min.css**: External link to Boxicons library for icons.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **HTML Structure**
The login form includes:
1. **Email Field**: A text input for the user to enter their email.
2. **Password Field**: A password input for the user to enter their password.
3. **Remember Me Checkbox**: A checkbox that allows users to stay logged in.
4. **Forgot Password Link**: A link for users who need to reset their password.
5. **Submit Button**: A button to submit the login credentials.

### **JavaScript Functionality**

While the provided code currently doesn't handle actual login, it includes a function for submitting the form. The validation checks ensure that the email and password fields are filled, and it also includes a basic email format validation. 

### **Icons**

The login form uses **Boxicons** for visual enhancements:
- A user icon for the email field.
- A lock icon for the password field.

### **CSS Styling**

The form is styled to be clean and responsive:
- **Centered Layout**: The form is centered on the page, making it visually appealing on all screen sizes.
- **Styled Input Fields**: Input fields and buttons are styled to have consistent padding, borders, and colors.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the files to your computer.
2. **Ensure Files Are Linked**: Verify that the `style.css` and Boxicons library are correctly linked in the HTML.
3. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to use the login form.
4. **Fill in Details**: Enter your email and password and click "Login" to submit (this will trigger the validation and display an error message if any field is missing or incorrect).

## üìç Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) that supports JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you wish to extend or modify the form.
